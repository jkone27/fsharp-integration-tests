## Easy API Testing üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This library makes use of [F# computation expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions) ü™î‚ú®  to hide some complexity of `WebApplicationFactory` and provide the user with a *domain specific language* (DSL) for integration tests. 

An "antique" C# API (üë¥üèΩü¶ñü¶ï) is also available since v.1.1 for enhanced accessibility üò∫.

## Documentation

Access the [documentation website](https://jkone27.github.io/fsharp-integration-tests/)  for more info on how to use this library.  

## Scenario

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant TestClient as Test
    participant MainApp as App
    participant DependencyApp as Dep

    TestClient->>MainApp: GET /Hello
    MainApp->>DependencyApp: GET /externalApi
    DependencyApp-->>MainApp: Response
    MainApp-->>TestClient: Response

```

## Test

```fsharp
open ApiStub.FSharp.CE
open ApiStub.FSharp.BuilderExtensions
open ApiStub.FSharp.HttpResponseHelpers
open Xunit

module Tests =

    // build your aspnetcore integration testing CE
    let test = new TestClient<Startup>()

    [<Fact>]
    let ``Calls Hello and returns OK`` () =

        task {

            let client = 
                test { 
                    GETJ "/externalApi" {| Ok = "yeah" |}
                }
                |> _.GetFactory()
                |> _.CreateClient()

            let! r = client.GetAsync("/Hello")

        }
```

### Test .NET C# ü§ù from F#

F# is a great language, but it doesn't have to be scary to try it. Integration and Unit tests are a great way to introduce F# to your team if you are already using .NET or ASPNETCORE. 

In fact you can add an `.fsproj` within a C# aspnetcore solution `.sln`, and just have a single F# assembly test your C# application from F#, referencing a `.csproj` file is easy! just use regular [dotnet add reference command](https://learn.microsoft.com/bs-latn-ba/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-reference).

## How to Contribute ‚úçÔ∏è

* Search for an open issue or report one, and check if a similar issue was reported first
* feel free to get in touch, to fork and check out the repo
* test and find use cases for this library, testing in F# is awesome!!!!
